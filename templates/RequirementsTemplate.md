# Stories and personas
George Nespresso

Male, 55, Digital Consultancy Factory Manager,  Divorced with a teenage son



George is one the most important employee of his society, a little digital consultancy born quite recently but growing up quickly. He has to take care of the Factory, the company's branch involved in software developing. One of his tasks is to manage the sale and the supply of the coffee capsules. More specifically he has to order three boxes of capsules twice per month, the first one at the beginning of the month, the other one in the middle.  He must take care of the orders of capsules from both factory's members and visitors and company clients as well. In this case who wants to buy them has to pay. Therefore he must take care of who payed and who didn't.



Goals

- Wants an easy way to see the payment status of each employee
- Needs a system to buy capsules as soon as possible in order to not waste too much time



It's 1st of May morning.

George just arrived in his office and today will be a busy day. As it is the first day of month, he has to report the Factory's status and progress during an afternoon talk with the company board and he also has to manage the capsule supply. So he decided to order the coffee as soon as possible in order to save more time for the report preparation. First of all access with his manager account in LaTazza. He has to order three boxes of capsules for the employees. He checks what remains from the previous month in order to buy what misses. Coffee capsules are over and arabic coffee is going to be over soon whereas all the kinds of tea are still available because they have been bought the previous month. George decides to buy only coffee and arabic coffee in order to have a homogeneous distribution. He also check if any employee has debts. In that case, George sends a solicitation email to remind to pay. After these routine procedures of beginning month, George logs out and starts immediately working on the presentation for the afternoon talk.

# Use case diagram and use cases


## Use case diagram
![](assets/RequirementsTemplate-245bfd75.png)
## Use Cases
In this paragraph are listed the most significant Use Cases of LaTazza system, with a brief description for each of them.
Log-In and Log-Out Use Cases are not described.
We assume that the company adopting LaTazza application has already defined a contract with capsules Supplier(s).

### Use Case 1, Create Employee account

An Employee can ask the Manager to create a LaTazza local account. An account grants the
  the possibility to buy credits (and pay using them instead of cash) and to take capsules in debt.
  The account creation process requires the Employee to choose only an username. A password is not needed since the account does not contain any sensible data.
  The accounts are stored in the Accounts_database.

| Actors Involved        | Manager, Employee |
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The account is created once the Manager has entered the username choosen by the Employee.|
|  Variants     | The username choosen by the Employee is already taken. |



### Use case 2, Sell capsules
 This Use Case is triggerd by a Client's request to buy some capsules. As
  mentioned before, an Employee can also pay by Credits or take capsules in debt. These situations can be seen as variants of the sub-Use Case Handle Payment (see Use Case Diagram).
  Cash, Credits and Debt are the only payment method supported.
	For a definition of Credits, see Domain Requirements.

| Actors Involved        | Manager, Client|
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The Client selects a payment method, chooses the capsule(s) number and typology, pays by cash and receives the capsule(s).|
|  Variants     | Credits payment; Debt payment; no capsules available for the selected number and/or typology; Employee exceeds MaxDebt threshold; thers isn't enough change.|

### Use case 3, Buy capsules

The Manager can issue an order to buy boxes of capsules with the company's
  Supplier. The payment is performed through the Bank/Credit Card System web APIs.
	Once an order is issued, it can't be canceled nor modified. For this reason, LaTazza does not allow to issue orders whose total amount exceeds the threshold value MaxAmountPerOrder (default is â‚¬100.00). The system does not automatically update the inventory after an order is issued, since the capsules are not yet available.

| Actors Involved        | Manager, Supplier, Bank/Credit Card Institute|
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The Manager selects the amount and typology of capsules boxes, inserts credit card information and pays.|
|  Variants     | The amount exceeds the MaxAmountPerOrder threshold; Internet connection failure; invalid credit card data.|

### Use case 4, Confirm order

 Once the Manager has received and checked the content of the order he/she has
  issued, he/she has to notify it to the system, which had kept track of the order's information to facilitate the update.

| Actors Involved        | Manager|
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The Manager looks for the order ID in the Orders List in the Summary window, confirms it.|
|  Variants     | System unable to correctly load orders' data. |

### Use case 5, Show Summary

LaTazza provides an overview of the status of the system called Summary. A
  Summary lists the following information: the Cash Account, the Inventory, the Orders List, the thresholds and capsules' prices set and a link to the Accounts Table. The Accounts Table's entries are tuples with the following attributes: account's Username, Credits, Debt.
	LaTazza automatically saves, once a day, a screenshot of the Summary as a read only file in the local file system.

| Actors Involved        | Manager|
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The Manager clicks on Summary button and LaTazza shows it. |
|  Variants     | System failure while loading data; the system shows incorrect data.|

### Use case 6, Pay off debts
 An Employee asks to repay the debts he/she has, or part of it.
  An Employee can't have a debt higher than the threshold value MaxDebt (default is â‚¬20.00).

| Actors Involved        | Manager, Employee|
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The Employee asks to repay the debt, handles cash to the Manager, the Manager updates the attribute "Debt" in the related entry of the Accounts Table.
|  Variants     | The Employee hasn't got sufficient cash to pay the debt. |   


### Use case 7, Buy Credits
An Employee asks the manager to buy Credits.

| Actors Involved        | Manager, Employee|
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The Employee asks the Manager to buy some Credits and pays for them. The Manager updates the attribute "Credits" in the related entry of the Accounts Table.   |
|  Variants     | Employee has asked for a number of credits he/she can not afford.|

### Use case 8, Set Parameters
The Manager can modify the values of MaxAmountPerOrder and MaxDebt, as well as the prices of the different typology of capsules.
Capsules' prices range is between â‚¬0.20 and â‚¬5.00.
MaxAmountPerOrder value range is between â‚¬20.00 and â‚¬500.00.

| Actors Involved        | Manager|
| ------------- |:-------------|
|  Nominal Scenario     | The Manager successfully updates thresholds and/or prices.|
|  Variants     | Manager sets a value which is out of bounds. |

A person, described by her name, surname and ID, can be an employee or a visitor. An employee can have an account, on which the number of credits or debts is recorded. Moreover, one of the employees is a manager. Anyone can request for a capsules sell, specifying the number of capsules of a certain type. The sell is under the control of the manager and it is linked to a payment record, described by a date and amount, and, in the case the buyer is an employee having an account, the number of debts and credits can be changed on it. The sell updates the summary, so the amount of cash account (in euro) and the number of capsules for each type. The update of the summary can be handled by the manager too.
The manager can request a capsules supply, specifying the number of boxes of a certain type of 50 capsules. The payment is associated to a company's credit card.
